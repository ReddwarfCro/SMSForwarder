# SMSForwarder

Android project for my private use

## the case;

I get second mobile phone, and thus second mobile phone number, but unfortunately phone is not dual sim. I transferred all my data 
to new phone, installed all application that I need on my new phone.

Setted communication apps (WhatsUp, Viber) to use my old mobile phone number on my new device and new number. I set Call forwarding from 
old number to new number. 

And what is left? SMS, yes in 2018 I still have some people that sends me SMS.

## solution;

I don't want to terminate my old phone number, and in some form,  I still want to use it for SMS. I quickly developed this small application 
and deploy it on my "old" mobile phone with old phone number.

## Usage

In some cases, I don't want to use this SMS Forward service, there is checkbox on application itself to disable SMS forwarding, And I added 
field to enter on witch number I want my SMS to be forwarded.

## Bonus stuff

If I forgot on my old phone, when battery is lower than 15% it will also send me SMS with friendly reminder to charge the phone
